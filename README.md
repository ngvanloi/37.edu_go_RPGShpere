# Hurricane - Part Project  

This is a part of a private project that focuses on developing a 2D game using Golang and Ebiten. The project covers designing maps using Tiled, adding animated characters, handling collision detection, and implementing combat features. This portion is a work in progress and is not the complete project.

### ðŸš€ Project Features  
- **Map Design:** Designed maps using the Tiled map editor and integrated them into the game.  
- **Animated Characters:** Added animated characters that move smoothly across the map.  
- **Collision Detection:** Implemented collision detection for characters to interact with the environment.  
- **Combat System:** Designed and began implementing combat features such as character attacks and health tracking.

## Tech Stack  

- **Programming Language:** Go (Golang)  
- **Game Library:** Ebiten  
- **Map Editor:** Tiled  
- **Animation:** Sprite sheet animation for characters and objects.

## Getting Started  

Follow these steps to run the project locally.  

### Prerequisites  
- Go (v1.16 or later)  
- Ebiten library installed  
- Tiled map editor (for map design)  

### Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ngvanloi/Hurricane.git
   cd Hurricane
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install Ebiten using Go:  
   ```bash
   go get github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2
   ```

3. **Build the Game**  
   To build and run the game, use the following command:  
   ```bash
   go run .
   ```

4. **Access the Game**  
   Once the game is running, follow the instructions in the terminal for gameplay.

## Features Implemented  

- **Map Integration:** Maps designed in Tiled can be loaded and rendered within the game.  
- **Character Animation:** Basic sprite sheet animations for movement and idle states are working.  
- **Collision Detection:** Characters interact with walls and other objects via collision checks.  
- **Combat Features:** Initial combat mechanics like basic attacks and health tracking have been started.

## Limitations and Next Steps  
This is just part of the complete game, with key features still being developed and refined. The remaining work will include completing the combat system, enhancing animations, and adding additional game mechanics.
